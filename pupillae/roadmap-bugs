List of Things to Do:

General:
error messages as returned by function exceptions.
Some function returns are just "results" that have say "Error: etc"

fons_gui:
- "Rotate image" function.
- crop function.
- copy original photos into ~~/tmp and delete on scale.
    ^ (???) this means that any photos in ~~/temp have not been saved to the database.

bugs:
- empty int fields persist previous value? see: squad_reps.
